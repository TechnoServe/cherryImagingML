ML for coffee cherry IQA grading

For the MVP, the process will involve a few simple steps:
1. Person with Android phone at the coffee wet mill (processing facility) takes pictures of
cherry in the top of the pulper bin at hourly intervals during processing​. The bins are 2-3 meters square at the top of the bin. Photos would be set up so that they are taken with consistent lighting, and we plan to include a color calibration card
2. Pictures are sent as an email attachment for analysis​ to an agreed email address.
3. The attachment(s) are analyzed using the ML algorithm
4. Scores for each picture returned to the sender via email for each picture​, and are recorded in a simple data base.

For the ML analysis, we would provide a spectrum of “ripeness” for the ML algorithm to analyze the photos.

A color calibration card would be used to ensure consistency of lighting/color evaluation for the algorithm

Production Solution
The production solution would provide a dashboard for each site for incoming quality of coffee cherry at each wet mill site, whereby each site could see the IQA trend for coffee cherry. Sites would only be able to see quality for their location, perhaps compared to a benchmark of aggregated and anonymized quality levels for other mills in the same region and in the country.
